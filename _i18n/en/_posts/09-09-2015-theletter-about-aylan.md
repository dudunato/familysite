Don't worry, my daughter. Aylan is with me now. Today I told him the reason of all these wars around the world, that I never wished it was like that. That in the beginning, I made tears to be of joy, but humanity chose to be away from me and now they cry because of sorrow.

Isabela helped me to explain him that not always the earthly daddies reflect my nature, The Father of Life, and they end up throwing their kids down the window. Some of the children from Realengo, in Rio de Janeiro, found our conversation quite interesting and joined us.

They told Aylan that I so loved them, that I sent my oldest Son, Jesus, to learn what it means to be killed when you are innocent. One of the kids got excited and told him the whole story of the Crucification day an with a big smile she told the little boy that only because of that day, they could be all there with me.

Alylan settled in my lap, caressed my face and said: "Thank you, heavenly daddy. Can I go get my brothers in Siria?" I answered: "No, my child. Leave that job for my other children."
